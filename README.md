# ReadMe-Generator

# Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

# Table of Contents


# Installation
 In order to use the application, the user will need to have node.js installed and then will need to clone the repository into the command line. Once the repository has been cloned, the user will need to change directories into the repository and run the command "npm install" in order to retrieve the neccessary dependencies.

# Usage
The application is designed to run within the command-line. Once the user has installed the program and run the "npm install" command, they will need to run "npm start" to begin the prompts regarding the README content. The user will then need to answer the questions accordingly and at the end they will receive a success message and a README will be generated within the folder.
